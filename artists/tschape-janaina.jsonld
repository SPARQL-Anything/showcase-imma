    "description" : "Born in Munich in 1973, Janaina Tschäpe spent her childhood in her mother’s hometown of São Paulo, Brazil. She moved to Hamburg in 1992 and attended the Hochschule für bildende Künste. She currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. Tschäpe’s paintings, films and photographs embody a sense of the extraordinary, where the everyday world metamorphoses into a mythical place, populated by fabricated creatures and florescent vegetation. She has exhibited extensively, including solo exhibitions at Galerie Catherine Bastide, Brussels; Galerie Xippas, Athens and the Contemporary Art Museum, St Louis. Tschäpe exhibited at IMMA in 2008.",
