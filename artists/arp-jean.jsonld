    "description" : "German-French artist Jean Arp studied at the Weimar Bauhaus before moving to Paris. Associated with Klee, Kandinsky, and the French avant-garde, Arp experimented with new techniques (torn paper, cut-outs) and materials (thread and relief sculpture). He has been linked to most of the major experimental art movements of the early 20th century - notably Surrealism and Dada. In 1954 Arp won the International prize for sculpture at the Venice Biennale.",
