They develop these ideas through material investigations and renditions of family, its bodies, and the spaces they move through and inhabit. Through a practice of film, performance, image and sculpture Rekab creates new intersectional narratives and objects for exhibition.", "Alice Rekab is a visual artist based in Dublin. Rekabâ€™s practice is concerned with expressions and iterations of complex cultural and personal narratives and seeks to understand the complexities of mixed-race Irish identity, from a personal and familial perspective.
