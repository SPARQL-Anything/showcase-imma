She investigates the way in which the body is represented and treated as an archive, which she then critically examines, disrupts and re-negotiates. Her work directly engages with representations and subjectification of the female body whilst activating it as a site and an agent for socio-political change. In doing so she creates spaces to expose and elude systems of representation and power.", "Alexis Blake has a multidisciplinary practice that coalesces visual art, movement and performance.
