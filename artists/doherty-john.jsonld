    "description" : "John Doherty studied architecture at Bolton Street College of Technology, and lived in Sydney for five years before deciding to become a painter. Taking as his subject matter Irelandâ€™s changing architectural and economic landscape, Doherty painstakingly records rural shop facades, petrol pumps, old boats and discarded oil drums which allude to the human stories not portrayed directly. Doherty has exhibited widely in Ireland and Australia. His work is represented in public collections including the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, and the Institute of Modern Art, Chicago.",
