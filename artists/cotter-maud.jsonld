    "description" : "Irish Artist Maud Cotter studied at the National College of Art and Design. Establishing her early reputation as a stained-glass artist, Cotter sought to redress the decorative and religious stereotypes associated with this medium. A visit to Iceland in 1991 precipitated a renewed interest in sculpture and the employment of materials such as steel, glass, perspex, cardboard, wax and latex. Cotter was co-founder of the National Sculpture Factory, Cork. She was elected as a member of Aosd√°na in 2000.",
