    "description" : "IIrish artist Corban Walker (born 1967) studied at the National College of Art and Design. Walker is known for his sculptures and installations relating to architectural scale and spatial perception and using industrial materials such as steel, aluminium, and glass. Influenced by the physical condition of Achondroplasia (Dwarfism), he challenges the philosophy of scale and how we, as inhabitants, relate to our environs. Walker was included in ‘Twenty’ at IMMA in 2011, and the same year he represented Ireland at the Venice Biennale and elected a member of Aosdána.",
