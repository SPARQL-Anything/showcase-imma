He received a Guggenheim fellowship in 1962, and had a solo show at MoMa, New York, the following year. Davidsonâ€™s work has been exhibited worldwide and included in a number of photographic publications. His awards include a Gold Medal Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Arts Club in 2007.",
