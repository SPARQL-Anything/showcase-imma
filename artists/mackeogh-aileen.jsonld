    "description" : "Irish sculptor Aileen MacKeogh studied at the National College of Art and Design and at Southern Illinois University in the US. Her work combined bronze, steel, stone, porcelain and glass and focused on aspects of domesticity and the vulnerability and fragility of human life. MacKeogh was the chairperson of the Irish Exhibition of Living Art from 1983 to 1987 and she lectured in Fine Art / Sculpture at the National College of Art and Design. She went on to be the first director of Arthouse in Temple Bar, before becoming head of Art, Design and Media at Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology.",
