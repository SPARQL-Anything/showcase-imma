    "dc:description" : "Adolph Gottlieb was an American Abstract Expressionist painter, sculptor and graphic artist. He studied in New York, Paris, Berlin and Munich. Gottlieb’s interest in automatic painting and in the myths and archetypes of tribal cultures became apparent in his art from the 1950s. He received numerous awards during his lifetime, including the Gran Premio at the São Paolo Biennial. Gottlieb was the subject of a major retrospective exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1968.",
