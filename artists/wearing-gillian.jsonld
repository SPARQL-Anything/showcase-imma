    "description" : "English artist Gillian Wearing (born 1963) studied at Goldsmiths, University of London, and Chelsea School of Art. Since the 1990s Wearing has challenged ideas of public and private, confession, self-exposure and voyeurism through the documentation of ordinary people in her photographic and film based practice. Wearing received the Turner Prize in 1997. She has exhibited extensively, including solo exhibitions at the Serpentine Gallery, London; Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Düsseldorf; Musée Rodin, Paris, and the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, Melbourne.",
