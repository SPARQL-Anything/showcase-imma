    "description" : "Nina Canell graduated from the Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design &amp; Technology in 2005. She creates sculptural installations which attempt to activate an intersection between humans, objects and events whereby a certain kind of material imagination might be articulated. The principle that the appearance of a given thing is the outcome of the happenings it has endured runs through her practice. Canell’s work has been show internationally, including the 2012 Sydney Biennale. She lives in Berlin.",
