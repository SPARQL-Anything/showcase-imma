    "description" : "American artist Elizabeth Peyton (born 1965) came to prominence in the early 1990s as one of the few young artists exploring figurative painting. Combining the historic and contemporary, the sources of inspiration for her paintings include such diverse figures as William Shakespeare, 19th-century Romantic authors, Nouvelle Vague filmmakers of the 1960s and musicians Patti Smith and Bob Dylan. Peyton has exhibited extensively. A major retrospective of her work was held at the New Museum in New York in 2009. She was the subject of a solo exhibition at IMMA in the same year.",
