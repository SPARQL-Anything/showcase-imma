    "description" : "English artist Tracey Emin attended the Medway College of Design, Rochester; Maidstone College of Art and the Royal College of Art, London. Using a range of media including paint, drawing, photography, needlework, sculpture, video and installation, Emin produces deeply personal works inspired by the events of her own life and the tradition of feminist discourse. Emin became known as a member of the YBA group in the 1990s. She was nominated for the Turner prize in 1999 and chosen to join the Royal Academy of Arts in 2007. The same year she represented Britain at the Venice Biennale. Major solo exhibitions include the Hayward Gallery, London in 2011 and Turner Contemporary, Margate in 2012. Emin was made a CBE in 2013 for services to the arts.",
