    "description" : "Spanish artist Ferran Garcia Sevilla moved from Palma de Majorca to Barcelona in 1969. Immersed in the Catalan conceptual art scene from that time, Sevilla’s eclectic painting style has drawn on such diverse influences as his trips to India and the Middle East, philosophy, mythology, comic books and urban graffiti. Sevilla has exhibited regularly across Europe from the 1980s, including important exhibitions at the Foundation Cartier, Paris; IVAM, Valencia and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Renia Sofía, Madrid. His painting practice was the subject of a solo exhibition at IMMA in 2010.",
