    "description" : [ "A massive machine whose very life depends on discipline, motion and speed. . . a mechanized army on wheels that rolls over any obstacle in its path. . . that meets calamity again and again, but always comes up smiling. . . a place where disaster and tragedy stalk the Big Top, haunt the backyards, and ride the circus rails. . . where Death is constantly watching for one frayed rope, one weak link, or one trace of fear.", "Irish artist Brian Duggan investigates the physical limitations of the immediate environment on the individual. Stress and pressure, ideas of control and where we stand, how we are tied and what binds us, are continuous references within his artistic practice. Duggan has exhibited in Ireland and Europe since 2000. He participated in IMMA’s Artists’ Residency Programme in 2011. His work was shown as part of Dublin Contemporary the same year. Duggan had a solo exhibition at Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane in 2012." ],
