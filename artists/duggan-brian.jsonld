Stress and pressure, ideas of control and where we stand, how we are tied and what binds us, are continuous references within his artistic practice. Duggan has exhibited in Ireland and Europe since 2000. He participated in IMMA’s Artists’ Residency Programme in 2011. His work was shown as part of Dublin Contemporary the same year. Duggan had a solo exhibition at Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane in 2012." ],
