    "description" : "Irish sculptor Vivienne Roche (born 1953) studied at the Crawford College of Art and Design, Cork, and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Working in a range of materials including bronze, plaster and glass, her sculpture makes formal reference to engineering, architecture and, most recently, the natural environment. Roche co-founded the National Sculpture Factory, Cork, in 1989. She has exhibited extensively nationally and internationally, and completed public commissions for CIT Cork School of Music, Wicklow County Council and the National College of Ireland.",
