    "description" : "Mexican painter Gunther Gerzso spent many years as a teenager in Switzerland living with his Uncle, Hans Wendland, who was an influential art historian and dealer. Returning to Mexico, Gerzso worked as a set designer and during the 1940s and 50s he created sets for films winning a total of five Premios Ariel for Best Production Design. In 1984 he worked with John Huston on ‘Under the Volcano’. Gerzo was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1973 and in 1978 was presented with Mexico’s highest artistic honour, the National Award for Arts and Sciences.",
