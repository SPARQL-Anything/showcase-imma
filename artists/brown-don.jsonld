    "dc:description" : "English sculptor Don Brown studied at the Central School of Art, London, and the Royal College of Art, London. Executed in materials including resin, silver and gold and often modelled on his own body or that of his wife Yoko, Brownâ€™s figurative sculptures reference the idealism and representational perfection of classical antiquity. Brown has exhibited nationally and internationally since the 1990s. His work is held in the collections of Tate Britain and Scheringa Museum of Realist Art, Spanbroek.",
