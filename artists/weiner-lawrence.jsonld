    "description" : "American Conceptual artist Laurence Weiner (born 1942) first exhibited his work in New York in the early 1960s. Taking language, and the way meaning is carried in words, symbols and codes, Weiner challenges traditional assumptions about the nature of the art object. He has exhibited internationally since the 1970s, including major solo exhibitions at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington D.C.; SFMOMA; Museo Tamayo Arte Contemporáneo, Mexico City, and the Tate Gallery, London.",
