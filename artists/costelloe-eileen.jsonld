  "description" : "Irish painter Eileen Costelloe attended the National College of Art and Design. She went on to study in Paris and the thick application of paint, often using a pallet knife, in her still lifes and landscapes indicate the influence of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism on her style. Costelloe regularly exhibited with the Water Colour Society of Ireland, the Ulster Society of Women Artists, the RHA and the David Hendriks Gallery. She was a member of the United Arts Club.",
