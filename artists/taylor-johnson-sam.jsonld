    "description" : "English artist Sam Taylor-Johnson (formerly Taylor-Wood, born 1967) graduated from Goldsmiths College, London, in 1990. Taylor-Johnson’s emotionally charged film and photographic works consider ideas of the isolated individual and our shared physical and physiological experiences. Taylor-Johnson was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1998. She has exhibited extensively, including solo exhibitions at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid; the Hayward Gallery, London; the State Russian Museum, St Petersburg; BALTIC, Gateshead, and the Contemporary Art Museum, Houston.",
