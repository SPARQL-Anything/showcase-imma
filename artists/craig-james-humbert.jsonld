  "description" : "Northern Irish artist James Humbert Craig briefly attended Belfast College of Art and was largely self-taught as a painter. His impressionistic scenes of Donegal, Connemara and Antrim brought him early recognition. Craig exhibited regularly at the RHA and the RUA and was elected a member of both organisations in 1928. His work is represented in public collections including the National Gallery of Ireland; Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane and Crawford Art Gallery, Cork.",
