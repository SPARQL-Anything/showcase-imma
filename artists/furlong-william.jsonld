    "description" : "English artist William Furlong studied at the Guildford School of Arts and Crafts and the Royal Academy School, London. Furlong belongs to the generation of British artists, which also includes Gilbert &amp; George, Bruce McLean and Richard Long, that developed a new concept of sculpture in the 1970s and 1980s. Furlong’s significant contribution has been in the area of sound and the mapping of the territory of contemporary art in a series of cassette editions. Furlong lives and works in London where he is a Professor of Fine Art at Wimbledon College of Art.",
