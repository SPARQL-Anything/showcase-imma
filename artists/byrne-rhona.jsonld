Site specificity is usually the point of departure for her creative process, involving research into a place and everyday relations. Byrneâ€™s works explore and engage with multilayered surfaces and workings of the built environment and navigates the intangible and transient layers of physical and psychological space.", "Often responding to a place or situation, Rhona Byrne makes objects, site-specific, gallery and context-based installations, films, publications and collaborative event-based projects that focus on the interplay between human beings and their surrounding environment at both macro and micro levels." ],
