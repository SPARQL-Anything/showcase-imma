With very&nbsp;different experiences and heritages as well as art and design specialisms, they each have their own&nbsp;individual practice across a range of media from urban design to miniature painting, video installation,&nbsp; poetry and sculpture. As well as staging exhibitions, events, workshops and engaging in research and experimental projects, Art Nomads aims to work as a capacity builder and advocate for artists from diverse and minority ethnic backgrounds in Ireland.",
