    "dc:description" : "Omar Rayo was a Colombian painter, sculptor and caricaturist. In 1970 he was awarded the Salón de Artistas Colombianos prize. His work employs abstract geometry using the restricted colours of black, white, red and yellow. Part of the Op Art movement, Rayo's practice was concerned with demonstrating that geometric art was not just of art historical interest but was still relevant to society and our ideas of the future.The Museo Rayo de Dibujo y Grabado Latinoamericano was founded by Rayo in his hometown of Roldanillo, Valle del Cauca, in 1981.",
