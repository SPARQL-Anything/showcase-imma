    "description" : "American artist Joseph Cornell was renowned as a pioneer of assemblage and an avant-garde experimental film maker. He began making collages in the early 1930s, followed by box constructions composed of assemblages created from found objects and ephemera. His box compositions reflected his interest in science, history and the lives of historical and contemporary people.",
