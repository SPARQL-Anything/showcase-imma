    "description" : "Polish artist Josef Herman studied at the Warsaw School of Art. He moved to Britain in 1940, living first in Scotland and then Wales. His figurative studies of Welsh miners and their families established him as a prominent figure in contemporary British art during the 1950s. Important showings of his work include the 1951 South Bank Festival of Britain exhibition and a solo exhibition at The Whitechapel Gallery in 1956. Herman is represented in many public and private collections.",
