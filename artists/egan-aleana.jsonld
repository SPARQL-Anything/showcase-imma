    "dc:description" : "Frequently absorbed by language and literature, Aleana Egan’s practice also acts as a response to the material world of architecture and to the sphere of human interaction. Imagining shapes as traces and memories Egan develops her sculptures as an emotional record of a built world, with her work often described as a process of collection and inclusion. Operating as a pause, a noting and a generative mining of the experience of different mediums, the components of her works are chosen for both their aesthetic and structural qualities. Solo exhibitions include Douglas Hyde Gallery, Dublin (2012); The Drawing Room, London (2011); Mole Vanvitelliana, Ancona (2010); Temple Bar Gallery, Dublin (2009); and Kunsthalle Basel, Switzerland (2008). Group exhibitions include ‘In the Line of Beauty’, Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin; Veneklasen/Werner, Berlin, and Jupiter Artland, Edinburgh (2013); Sculpture Center, New York and Landesmuseum Münster, Germany (2010); 5th Berlin Biennale, Berlin and Kunsthalle zu Kiel (2008).",
