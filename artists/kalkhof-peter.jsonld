    "description" : "German artist Peter Kalkhof studied painting at the School of Arts and Crafts, Braunschweig; the Academy of Fine Art, Stuttgart; the Slade School of Fine Art, London, and the École des Beaux-Arts, Paris. Kalkhof’s abstract, often large scale paintings are concerned with colour and space. His extensive travels and visits to man-made sacred sites, churches, holy caves and other monumental structures where geometry has been used as a sacred form have influenced his practice. Kalkhof taught in the Fine Art Department at the University of Reading.",
