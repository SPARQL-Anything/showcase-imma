    "dc:description" : "American artist Ellen Gallagher attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts, and the Skowhegan School of Art, Maine. Her work explores race and racial stereotyping, as evinced through the language and imagery employed in printed material such as 19th century minstrel playbooks. Gallagher received the American Academy Award in Art in 2000. She has exhibited extensively in the last decade, including the 2003 Venice Biennale. Her work is represented in public collections worldwide. Gallagher lives and works in Rotterdam, The Netherlands and New York City.",
