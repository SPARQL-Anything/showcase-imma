    "dc:description" : "Cherokee artist Jimmie Durham is a sculptor, writer and poet. Durham studied at L'École des Beaux-Arts, Geneva. He returned to the US in 1973 to become a full-time organizer in the American Indian Movement (AIM). During this time he also served as director of the International Indian Treaty Council and representative to the United Nations. For Durham, art and its institutions are inseparable from political life. The use of found objects in his work alludes to the classical Western philosophical divisions between mind and body. Durham participated in Artists’ Residency Programme at IMMA in 1993.",
