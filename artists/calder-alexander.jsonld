    "description" : "American artist Alexander Calder worked as an engineer before deciding to pursue a career as an artist. He attended the Art Students League in New York and moved to Paris in 1926, where he established a studio and became friends with a number of avant-garde artists, including Joan Míro. He returned to the US in 1933 and settled in France in 1962. Calder is best known for his wire sculptures, suspended mobiles and monumental outdoor sculptures. In 1952 he represented the US at the Venice Biennale and was awarded the main prize for sculpture. His work is represented in significant public collections worldwide including the Whitney Museum of American Art; MoMA, New York and the Centre Pompidou, Paris.",
