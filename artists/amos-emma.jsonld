Four years later, she joined 'Spiral', a collective of black artists engaged with the civil rights movement and the plight of blacks in America. From 1980, until her retirement in 2008, Amos taught at the Mason Gross School of Art, Rutgers University. Her work has been exhibited internationally and is included in public collections throughout America.",
