    "dc:description" : "Northern Irish artist Philip Flanagan graduated from Camberwell College, London in 1985. He worked first in sculpture and then turned to abstract painting. Flanagan’s paintings have an underlying sculptural feel from both their composition and the layers of colour the artist builds up. Flanagan received First Prize for Painting at Queen’s University Belfast in 2004. His work is held in private and public collections including University College Dublin; Dublin Writers’ Museum; the Ulster Museum, Belfast, and Queen’s University, Belfast.",
