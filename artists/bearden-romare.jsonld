    "dc:description" : "African-American artist Romare Bearden studied at the Art Students League in New York under George Grosz. Together with Hale Woodruff, Bearden formed the Spiral group in 1963. He is primarily known for his ‘photomontage projections’ where cut-outs from magazines are collaged with his own painting and later photographically enlarged. He was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 1987 and was a member of the American Institute of Arts and Letters.",
