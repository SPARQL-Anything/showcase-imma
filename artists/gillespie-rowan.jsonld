    "description" : "Irish sculptor Rowan Gillespie attended York School of Art; Kingston College of Art, London, and Kunst og Handverk Skole, Oslo. Working in bronze, Gillespie favours the traditional method of lost wax casting as a way of directly engaging with the materials of his craft. Gillespie has exhibited widely and created site-specific sculptures for locations across Ireland. His work is represented in many public collections, including the National Self-Portrait Collection; the Tyrone Guthrie Centre and the National Maternity Hospital, Dublin.",
