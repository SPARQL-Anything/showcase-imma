    "description" : "Welsh painter Nancy Wynne Jones (1922-2006) attended the Royal Academy of Music and the Chelsea School of Art. Wynne Jones was a significant figure in the Cornish artistic community of St Ives for many years before moving to Ireland in 1972. Her richly textured, semi-abstract works convey the landscapes of Cornwall and Ireland in an atmospheric manner. Wynne Jones exhibited regularly in Ireland and was elected an honorary member of the RHA.",
