    "description" : "Brazilian artist Vik Muniz developed his art practice as a sculptor in New York in the 1980s. He then began to experiment with drawing and photography. Concerned with the process of ‘seeing’ in a culture saturated with visual imagery, Muniz recreates famous images in materials ranging from dust and chocolate to toy soldiers and sweets. Muniz’s work has been shown extensively worldwide, including a solo exhibition at IMMA in 2004. The film ‘Waste Land’, documenting a project he carried out in Jardim Gramacho, Rio de Janeiro, was nominated for an Academy Award in 2010.",
