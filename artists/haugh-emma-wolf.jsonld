    "description" : [ "Emma Wolf Haugh is a visual artist and educator based in Dublin and Berlin. Working across disciplines she weaves together installation, performance, publishing and collaborative workshop techniques. Haugh is interested in re-orienting attention in relation to cultural narratives and develops her work from a working class-queer-feminist questioning of what is missing? A continued engagement with club culture and dyke aesthetics informs the collective making of temporary, autonomous spaces. A background in working with Augusto Boals’ Theatre of the Oppressed has inflected her work with the particular quality of overlapping critique and proposition making towards shared spaces of potential and alterity.", "Emma Wolf-Haugh is a visual artist and educator. Weaving together installation, performance, publishing and collaborative workshop techniques, she is interested in reorienting attention towards cultural narratives by developing work from a questioning of ‘what is missing’.

Haugh has worked with: The Academy of Fine Arts Vienna (2017); The Universität der Künste Berlin (2017); IADT Dún Laoghaire (2017); NCAD, Dublin (2015); Hamburger Bahnhof Berlin (2018); Akademie der Künste der Welt, Cologne (2018) and Gasworks, London (2017).
