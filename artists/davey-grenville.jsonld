    "dc:description" : "English sculptor Grenville Davey studied at Exeter College of Art and Design and Goldsmiths College, London. From the mid-1980s, his increasingly large scale sculptural works have addressed ideas of pairing, duality, scale and gravity. Davey has exhibited extensively in Britain and internationally, and completed public commissions for the Arts Council of England; the Olympic Park, London; Yorkshire Sculpture Park and Goodwood Sculpture Park, West Sussex. He was awarded the Turner Prize in 1992.",
