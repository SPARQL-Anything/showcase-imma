    "description" : [ "Born in Dublin, Michael Craig-Martin studied art at Yale University in America in the 1960s, where he was influenced by theories of conceptual art. In the 1980s Craig-Martin taught at Goldsmith’s College and was significant influence on the emerging YBA generation. Craig-Martin’s early art practice involved the use of ready-mades. During the 1990s the focus of his work moved to painting, and to increasingly complex site-specific wall paintings. In 1996 Whitechapel Gallery, London held a retrospective of his work and in 2006 IMMA presented ‘Michael Craig-Martin: Works 1964-2006’.", "Born in Dublin, Michael Craig-Martin studied art at Yale University in America in the 1960s, where he was influenced by theories of conceptual art.
