    "description" : "Irish artist Tim Goulding studied Textile Design at Konstfackskolan, Stockholm, before becoming a painter. Located in West Cork since 1969, Goulding’s semi abstract compositions are triggered by an emotional response to the land and environment. Goulding represented Ireland at the Paris Biennale in 1971 and at Cagnes-sûr-Mer in 1977. He has exhibited nationally and internationally. His paintings are held in public collections, including the Arts Council of Ireland; Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane; Trinity College Dublin and the National Self-Portrait Collection, Limerick.",
