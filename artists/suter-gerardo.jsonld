    "description" : "Argentinian born Gerardo Suter (born 1957) moved to Mexico in 1970. Largely self-taught as a photographer, Suter began photographing theatre and dance performances for the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico in 1978. From the 1980s he has worked with photography, film and installation to consider the history and culture of Mexico, and ideas of collective memory, ritual and myth. Suter represented Mexico at the São Paulo Biennial in 1996, and at the Havana Biennial in 2000. His work is included in many public and private collections.",
