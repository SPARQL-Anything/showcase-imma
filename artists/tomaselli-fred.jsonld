    "description" : "American artist Fred Tomaselli (born 1956) studied painting at California State University, Fullerton, before moving to New York in 1985. Tomaselliâ€™s collaged paintings are remarkable compendia of natural and unnatural worlds. Combining unorthodox materials, such as prescription pills, herbal remedies and psychoactive plants, they draw parallels between the mind-altering properties of these substances and the traditional understanding of painting as a window to another reality. Tomaselli has exhibited extensively in Europe and the US, including a solo exhibition at IMMA in 2005. His works are held in major public collections worldwide.",
