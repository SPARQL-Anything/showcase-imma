    "description" : "Locky Morris has exhibited both regionally and internationally since the mid-1980s. Morrisâ€™s work touches on a broad range of subjects, from the highly personal and familial, to the political. Renowned for his early work that explicitly dealt with The Troubles in Northern Ireland, Morris has also received acclaim for his quietly powerful and intimate work, infused with a dark wit.",
