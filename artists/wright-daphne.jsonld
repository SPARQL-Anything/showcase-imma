    "description" : [ "Daphne Wright makes multi-narrative sculptural installations using a variety of techniques and media, including fragile materials such as plaster, tinfoil, unfired clay, sound and video. She is curious about how a range of languages and materials can be used to probe often unspoken human preoccupations. Concerned with boundaries and the transitory areas of life, she explores the cusp of childhood and adulthood, as well as the spaces and borderlines between life and death. Animals and plants, with their shorter life cycles, often stand in for humans in her work.", "Daphne Wright makes multi-narrative sculptural installations using a variety of techniques and media, including fragile materials such as plaster, tinfoil, unfired clay, sound and video." ],
