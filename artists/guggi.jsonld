    "dc:description" : "Irish artist Guggi was born Derek Rowen in Dublin. He was part of the avant-garde band The Virgin Prunes from 1976 until 1984, when he left to become a full-time artist. Initially working in landscape, Guggi has developed a distinctive visual language based on abstracted vessel and bowl forms. He has exhibited widely since the 1990s, including solo exhibitions at the Kerlin Gallery, Dublin; the Accademia Fine Art, Monaco; Freies Museum, Berlin, and Yoshii Gallery, New York.",
