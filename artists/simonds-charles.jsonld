    "description" : "American artist Charles Simonds (born 1945) began working with clay while studying art at the University of California, Berkeley. His early miniature ‘dwellings’, built in Manhattan for an imaginary population of little people, became the foundation for an art practice that encompasses sculpture, performance, street art and activism. Simonds’ dwellings have appeared in cities worldwide. His work has also been exhibited extensively, including solo exhibitions at the Fundacion Bilbao Arte, Bilbao; the lnstitut Valencia d'Art Modern; the Joseph Helman Gallery, New York, and the Denver Art Museum, Colorado.",
