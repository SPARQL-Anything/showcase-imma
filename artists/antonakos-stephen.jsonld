    "description" : "Born in Greece, Stephen Antonakos moved with his family to New York in 1930. He served in the Army before starting a career as a commercial illustrator. Antonakos’ work developed from early architectural drawings and painting, to collages and assemblages incorporating found materials. He abandoned easel painting in 1959 and began to work with lighted glass. He is primarily known for his indoor and outdoor neon installations.",
