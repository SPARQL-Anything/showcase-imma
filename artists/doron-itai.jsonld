Informed by the narrative of cinema, Doron uses photography, video and installation to explore issues of migration and community, documenting selected locations and marginalised people. Doron exhibited at the inaugural exhibition of White Cube, London, in 1993. He has since participated in numerous group and solo exhibitions in Europe, Japan, Israel and the US.",
