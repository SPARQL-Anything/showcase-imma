    "dc:description" : "Mathias Goeritz was a German-born Mexican painter and sculptor. He studied Philosophy and Art History in Berlin at Friedrich-Wilhelms Universitat and received his doctorate in 1941. He also trained as an artist at the Berlin-Charlottenberg School of Arts and Crafts. In 1942 he married photographer Marianne Gast and settled in Spain before moving to Mexico in 1949 where he became Professor of Visual Education and Drawing at the School of Architecture at the University of Guadalajara. He founded the Altimira School, an association of artists and writers and was instrumental in establishing abstraction in Mexico with the founding of the Museo Experimental El Eco in Mexico City. In addition to his own work, Goeritz collaborated with a number of architects and in 1957 created the monumental sculpture ‘The Towers of Satélite’.",
