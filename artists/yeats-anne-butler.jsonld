    "description" : "Irish painter and set designer Anne Butler Yeats studied at the RHA Schools. She worked as chief stage designer at the Abbey Theatre before taking up painting full time and developed a bold, expressionist style in her landscape, still life and figurative oils. Yeats's works were exhibited widely in Ireland and abroad and are held in numerous private and public collections worldwide. Significant retrospective exhibitions of her work were held at the RHA in 1995 and the National Gallery of Ireland in 2002.",
