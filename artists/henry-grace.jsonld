    "description" : "Scottish painter Grace Henry studied at Blanc Garrins Academy, Brussels, and the Delecluse Academy, Paris. She married Belfast born artist Paul Henry in 1903. Henry moved to Achill Island with her husband in 1912. Henry was influenced by both the unique landscape and people of Achill, whom she recorded. She exhibited in Ireland and Europe from the 1910s, including at the Royal Hibernian Academy and the Victor Waddington Galleries, Dublin. She moved to Dublin in 1919. Henry was made an honorary member of the RHA in 1949.",
