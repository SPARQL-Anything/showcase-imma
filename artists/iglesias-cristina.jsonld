    "description" : "Spanish sculptor and installation artist Cristina Iglesias combines techniques from sculpture, architecture, theatre, printmaking, photography and film to create evocative environments featuring canopies, passageways and curving walls. Re-shaping the real space in which they are placed, her works require the interaction of the viewer. Iglesias represented Spain at the Venice Biennale in 1986 and 1993. She has exhibited widely, including solo exhibitions at the Guggenheim, Bilbao in 1997 and at IMMA in 2003.",
