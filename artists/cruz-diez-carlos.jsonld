    "description" : "Venezuelan kinetic artist Carlos Cruz-Diez studied at the School of Fine Arts in Caracas. He worked in illustration and advertising before leaving Venezuela to live in Spain and France. Throughout his career Cruz-Diez has investigated the nature of colour as an autonomous reality and the active participation of the viewer in visual art. Cruz-Diez exhibited extensively from the 1960s. His work is represented in major collections including MoMA, New York; the Tate Gallery, London, and the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris.",
