    "description" : "Irish artist Chris Doris works in painting, drawing, print, performance and installation to examine ideas of spiritual practice, consciousness and its transformation. A practitioner of the Sahaj Marg System of Raj Yoga, he attempts to affect the collective of which he is a part, through the personal transformation intrinsic to his art practice. Doris has exhibited extensively since the 1990s. His work is represented in public and private collections including the Arts Council and the Contemporary Irish Arts Society.",
