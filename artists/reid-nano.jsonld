  "dc:description" : "Irish painter Nano Reid (1900–1981) studied under Seán Keating and Harry Clarke at the Metropolitan School of Art, Dublin. She then attended the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, Paris, and the Central School, London. Reid returned to Ireland in the early 1930s. Her intuitive painting style, inspired by the local landscape, combined abstraction and figuration. Reid exhibited nationally and internationally from the 1950s. Together with Norah McGuinness, she represented Ireland at the Venice Biennale in 1950. Her work is represented in significant national public collections, including Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane and the Arts Council of Ireland.",
