    "description" : "South Korean painter Kim En Joong studied at the School of Fine Arts in Seoul. He later became an art teacher in a Catholic seminary where he discovered Catholicism. En Joong was baptised in 1967 and ordained a bother of the Dominican Order in 1974. Based in Paris in 1989, he created his first stained glass window. His stained glass works now adorn religious and non-religious buildings worldwide. In 2010 En Joong received the insignia of d’Officier dans l’ordre des Arts et Lettres, for the realisation of 37 windows of the Basilica of Saint-Julien Brioude.",
