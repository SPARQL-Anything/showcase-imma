    "dc:description" : "American conceptual artist Matt Mullican (born 1951) graduated from Cal Arts in 1974 and gained recognition as a member of the ‘Pictures Generation’. Within his art practice Mullican considers ideas of communication through a common pictorial language and the potential for visual signifiers to surpass the verbal. Working with a range of media, including bulletin boards, banners, tapestry and computer generated images, Mullican blurs the distinction between fine art and commercial design. Mullican has exhibited internationally since the 1970s. He has taught at Columbia University, New York; The London Institute and Chelsea College of Art and Design, London.",
