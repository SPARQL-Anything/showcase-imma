    "description" : "British artist Gavin Turk (born 1967) studied at Chelsea School of Art and the Royal College of Art, London. Frequently using his own name or image and those of iconic art historical figures, Turkâ€™s installation and sculptural works consider ideas of authorship, authenticity and the elevated role of the artist as propagated by the art world. Turk has exhibited internationally, including solo exhibitions at David Nolan Gallery, New York; Ben Brown Gallery, London; Galerie Krinzinger, Vienna and Galerie Almine Rech, Paris. He has also completed a number of public sculpture commissions.",
