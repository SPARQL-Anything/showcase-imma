    "description" : "Vivienne Dick is a celebrated filmmaker and artist. She began making Super 8 films while living in New York in the late seventies. Dick was a key figure within ‘No Wave’, a short-lived avant-garde scene in the late 1970s in New York led by a collective of musicians, filmmakers and artists including Nan Goldin, Lydia Lunch, Arto Lindsay, James Chance and many others. Her work is marked by an interest in urban street life, social and sexual politics, and the history of ideas.",
