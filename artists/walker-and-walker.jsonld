  "description" : [ "Walker and Walkerâ€™s work is research driven and diverse in its range of materials, methods and references. Exploiting the threshold of meaning and its construction, they create installations that emphasise factors which cannot be easily defined, such as the overlooked in typography, the misreading of a text, the ill-defined or unresolved, opening up new narratives where stabilities are shifted and undone, and the seemingly incoherent produces new readings. They have recently produced a new publication of their work Return Inverse (2017).", "Joe Walker and Pat Walker have been collaborating since 1989. They co-represented Ireland at the 51st International Venice Biennale in 2005 and have exhibited widely nationally and internationally. Their work is research driven and diverse in its range of materials, methods and references. " ],
