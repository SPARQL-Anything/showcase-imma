    "dc:description" : "Welsh-born artist Brian Robins (1928-1988) left school at fourteen and was a self-taught sculptor. Opposed to any form of limitation, convention or dogma, his research into the formal possibilities of pure pattern and geometrical abstract art led him to kinetic art during the 1950's. His first one-man show of kinetic structures was held at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1966.",
