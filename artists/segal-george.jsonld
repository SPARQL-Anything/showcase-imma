    "description" : "American artist George Segal (1924-2000) attended the Cooper Union School of Art, the Pratt Institute and New York University. Initially a painter, Segal turned to sculpture in the late 1950s. Constructed with chicken wire, burlap and plaster bandages, his cast body sculptures sit in environments assembled from found objects. Segal’s work has been exhibited worldwide, including major retrospectives at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington; Sidney Janis Gallery, New York; the Museo Arte Contemporanea di Roma and the State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg.",
