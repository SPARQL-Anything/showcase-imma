  "description" : [ "Sean Hanrahan is a multidisciplinary artist who often works with the mediums of flags and banners on various curated public exhibitions and projects since 2014. He is interested in place, location, and historical proximity of sites. These interests and reflections inform the production of visual displays that act as temporary signals to highlight a distinct sense of place, they are made where they belong or are handed over to the public arena. Hanrahanâ€™s work has an ongoing interest in creating fine art print work, informed by photography with an emphasis on experimenting with processes to create portrait and abstract works.", "Sean Hanrahan is a multidisciplinary artist who often works with the mediums of flag and banners on various curated public exhibitions and projects since 2014." ],
