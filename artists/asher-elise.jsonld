    "description" : "Chicago born Elise Asher was a poet, painter and sculptor. She studied art in Chicago and Boston, before moving to New York in 1947. Here Asher began to paint mystical landscapes in a vivid palette. She had her first solo show in New York in 1953, and two years later published her first poetry collection. She rendered her own and others’ poetry on canvas in oil or acrylics on plexiglass and also translated objects into verse. Her work is in many public and private collections. The Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown held a retrospective of her work in 2000.",
