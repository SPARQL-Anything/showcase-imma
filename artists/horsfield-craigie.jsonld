    "description" : "The work of British artist Craigie Horsfield is informed by a debate about the individual and the community, and arts relationship to the world in which we live. His non-narrative photographs of individual people and objects in space use the language of the commonplace to investigate the relation of the past to the present. Horsfield was shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 1996. More recently, Horsfield has been producing photo tapestries. Those were the subject of a large solo exhibition at M HKA, Antwerp, in 2010.",
