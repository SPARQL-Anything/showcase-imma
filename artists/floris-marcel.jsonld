His early works were metal constructions based on geometrical planes and the use of mirrors. Floris was awarded National Prizes for Painting and Sculpture in Venezuela in the 1960s. He received a Gold Medal at the 1971 Sao Paulo Biennale. He settled in the Balearic Island of Ibiza in the same year.",
