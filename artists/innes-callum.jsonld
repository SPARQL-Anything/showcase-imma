    "dc:description" : "Scottish abstract painter Callum Innes attended Gray's School of Art and Edinburgh College of Art. Working largely in monochrome, Innesâ€™s process is one of subtraction - applying and then removing paint from the surface of the canvas to produce works with an enigmatic, meditative quality. Innes was shortlisted for the Turner Prize and the Jerwood Prize in 1995. He received the NatWest Art Prize in 1998. Innes has exhibited throughout Europe and American. A solo exhibition of his work was held at IMMA in 1999.",
