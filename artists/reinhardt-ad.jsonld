    "description" : "American abstract painter Ad Reinhardt (1913-1967) studied at Columbia University, the American Artists' School and the National Academy of Design, New York. He became a member of the American Abstract Artists in 1937. Initially influenced by cubism, from the 1940s Reinhardt developed a gestural, linear style aligned with the Abstract Expressionist painters. His return to geometric shapes in the next decade positioned him as a precursor of minimalism and conceptual art. His work is represented in major public collections worldwide.",
