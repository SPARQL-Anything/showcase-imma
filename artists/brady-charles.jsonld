    "description" : "Painter Charles Brady was born in New York and studied at the Art Students League there. He first visited Ireland in 1956 and settled here permanently in 1959. Brady was best known as a painter of everyday objects in an understated manner, usually on a modest scale. He exhibited extensively in Ireland and the United States and was the subject of a major retrospective at the RHA in 2001.",
