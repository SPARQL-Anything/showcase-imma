    "description" : "English artist Prunella Clough attended the Chelsea School of Art, London, before serving as an engineer's draughtsman during the Second World War. In her early drawings, paintings and prints, Clough focused on Britain’s post war urban and industrial landscapes. She went on to experiment with abstraction from 1966. Clough exhibited frequently and a major solo exhibition of her work took place at Camden Arts Centre in 1996. She was the winner of the 1999 Jerwood Prize for painting.",
