    "description" : "Born in Philadelphia to Russian parents, Eve Arnold began to take photographs while working at a photo-finishing plant in New York City. She went on to study photography at the New School for Social Research, New York in 1948. Arnold joined Magnum Photos in 1951 and moved to England in the 1960s, where she worked for the Sunday Times magazine. She travelled worldwide, photographing in China, Afghanistan, South Africa and Russia, and also made portraits of celebrated public figures such as Queen Elizabeth II, Malcolm X, and Marilyn Monroe. In 1995 she was made fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and elected Master Photographer by New York’s International Center of Photography. She published numerous books and exhibited her work worldwide.",
