    "description" : "English painter and printmaker Patrick Caulfield entered the Royal College of Art in 1960 where his contemporaries included David Hockney, Allen Jones and R.B. Kitaj. The striking black line technique he developed at the Royal College proved to be a versatile pictorial device which he retained in his flat, figurative works that often portray a few simple objects in an interior. Caulfield was nominated for the Turner prize in 1987 and was made a CBE in 1996.",
