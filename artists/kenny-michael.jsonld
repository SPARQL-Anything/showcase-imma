    "description" : "English artist and sculptor Michael Kenny entered the Liverpool College of Art in 1959 and went on to study at the Slade School of Fine Art, London. His contemplative geometric stone works address the isolation of the human condition. Kenny lectured at the Slade School throughout the 1970s. He served as Head of the Fine Art Department at Goldsmiths College, London between 1983 and 1988. Kenny was elected Associate of the Royal Academy in 1976, and a Royal Academician in 1986.",
