    "description" : "American artist Jack Pierson (born 1960) studied at the Massachusetts College of Art, Boston. His practice incorporates photography, sculpture, drawings, installation and found objects to explore the emotional undercurrents of everyday life, the intimacy of romantic attachment and the idolising of stars of stage and screen. Pierson has exhibited widely in America and Europe, including a solo exhibition at IMMA in 2008. His work is represented in major collections including the Guggenheim Museum, New York, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.",
