    "description" : "American painter Suzanne Caporael studied at the Otis College of Art and Design, Los Angeles. Combining figuration and abstraction, her painting practice is based on a close and continuous observation of the natural world. Caporael has exhibited consistently since the mid-1980s. Her work is represented in significant American collections including the Art Institute of Chicago; SFMOMA; The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and Yale University. Caporael has also held teaching positions at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the San Francisco Art Institute.",
