    "description" : "Austrian artist Fritz Fröhlich studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. Fröhlich worked as a painter in Linz before travelling to Italy and Spain in the late 1950s. Initially interested in landscape, Fröhlich’s observation of the Moorish culture in Granada led to an increasing consideration of man and his personal environment in his visual art practice. Fröhlich exhibited widely from the 1970s. A major retrospective of his work was held in the Nordico Stadtmuseum Linz in 2001.",
