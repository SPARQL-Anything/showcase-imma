    "description" : "Gilbert Proesch (born Italy, 1943) and George Passmore (born England, 1942) met as sculpture students at St. Martin’s School of Art, London. They soon began to create art and exhibit together. Using themselves as 'living sculptures', GILBERT &amp; GEORGE explore the psyche and life of modern man. Promoting the idea of ‘art for all’, the provocative style of their work has, in spite of harsh criticism, achieved international popularity. GILBERT &amp; GEORGE have won numerous awards, including the Turner Prize in 1986. They represented Britain at the Venice Biennale in 2005.",
