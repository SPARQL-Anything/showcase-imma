  "description" : [ "Neil Carroll’s practice sets out to explore the ability of pictorial space to meaningfully express and embody a perceived shift in how we conceptually construct the anthropological condition of the human figure and the contemporary space it occupies. It manifests these changes by re-negotiating with the painting format in a broader sense, breaking with the traditional bounds of representative, objective, architectural and urban space and forming a relationship with a more abstract, dynamic and transformable space.", "Neil Carroll’s practice sets out to explore the ability of pictorial space to meaningfully express and embody a perceived shift in how we conceptually construct the anthropological condition of the human figure and the contemporary space it occupies." ],
