    "description" : "American artist Philip Taaffe (born 1955) studied at Cooper Union in New York. Taaffe’s vivid, abstract paintings employ symbols drawn from a vast array of cultural and historical sources, from Islamic architecture and Eastern European textile design, to calligraphy and information technology. Taaffe has exhibited extensively in Europe and the US, including a solo exhibition at IMMA in 2011. Taaffe’s work is represented in major public collections including those of the MoMA, New York; the Guggenheim Museum, New York, and the Reina Sofía Museum, Madrid.",
