    "description" : "English painter and writer Keith Vaughan (1912 – 1977) left a career in advertising to pursue painting in 1939. From 1941 until 1944 he served with the army in the Pioneer Corps which inspired his drawings of army life. Vaughan taught at Camberwell School of Art, London from 1946 to 1948 and at the Central School of Arts and Crafts from 1948 to 1957. He travelled widely and was resident artist at Iowa State University in 1959 before returning to London to teach at the Slade School of Fine Art between 1959 and 1977. Vaughan was awarded a CBE in 1965.",
