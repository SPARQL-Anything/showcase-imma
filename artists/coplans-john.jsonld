    "dc:description" : "British artist John Coplans moved to San Francisco in 1960 to teach at the University of California, Berkeley. He was a founding editor of ‘Artforum’ in 1962. From the 1960s he also worked as a curator. In 1984 Coplans began photographing his own naked body as a provocative contrast to society’s perpetual youth cult. He went on to publish some twenty books of photographs of his body. His works are included in the collections of MoMA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. New York..",
