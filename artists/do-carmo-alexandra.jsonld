    "dc:description" : "Portuguese artist Alexandra do Carmo studied at Ar.CO, Lisbon, the Pratt Institute, Brooklyn and the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program, New York. Her drawing, installation, video, photography and performance work investigates the position of the artist in society and the possibility of discourse between the artist and the public as a means of creating a more lateral, integrated artistic practice. Do Carmo has exhibited in Portugal, Spain, Germany, Ireland and the US. She participated in IMMA’s Artists’ Residency Programme in 2006.",
