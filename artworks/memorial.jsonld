    "description" : "‘Memorial’ completes the suite of work with which Maguire represented Ireland at the 1998 São Paulo Biennial. It refers to the massacre of 111 prisoners in the Carandiru penitentiary in São Paulo by police and other inmates in 1992. The death count was said to be far more than the 111 victims claimed in the official account, and the ghostly palette and the placement of the figures in Maguire’s painting gives the impression that this is merely an indication of a bigger incident.",
