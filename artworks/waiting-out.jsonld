    "description" : "Waiting Out, 2017 is a solo performance for FIX17 and was commissioned by Catalyst Arts, Belfast. In the performance Johnston creates a tension between objects and her body through physical actions. Natural actions are extended beyond themselves to strike up images that create a tension between the audience and performer. Johnson explores physical states of responsiveness formed in relation to the actualities of specific situations at the moment of making.",
