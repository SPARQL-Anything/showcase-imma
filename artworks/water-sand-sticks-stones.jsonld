    "description" : "The outdoor work, ‘(…) Water &amp; Sand + Sticks &amp; Stones (…)’, which was installed in the East Arch of the Royal Hospital in 1993, was originally placed in another configuration – on the first floor landing of the Museum as part of the exhibition ‘Projects’ by Lawrence Weiner. Since its acquisition, the piece has been included in a number of exhibitions at IMMA as well as in external venues. The work is flexible, can be realised in a number of ways, in a variety of different media. It can be shown simultaneously in multiple locations.",
