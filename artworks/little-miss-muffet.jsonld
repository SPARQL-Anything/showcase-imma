    "description" : "‘Little Miss Muffet’ was made in response to a request from the artist Paula Rego’s grandchild, who did not seem at all distressed, as Rego recalls, by the enlarged spider, and adult face. She also mentions that it has Freudian connections, in that Freud believed that the mother was often perceived as a spider, capturing a child by all her limbs and encroaching on her life.",
