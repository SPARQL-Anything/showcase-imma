    "description" : "Wait it Out, 2019 is a solo performance commissioned by the Project Arts Centre. In the performance Johnston creates a tension between objects and her body through physical actions. Natural actions are extended beyond themselves to strike up images that creates intensity between the audience and performer. Johnson explores physical states of responsiveness formed in relation to the actualities of specific situations at the moment of making. Photography: Senija Topcic",
