    "description" : "“Present” Rainbow is one of a large number of rainbow works produced by British artist Patrick Hughes from the 1970s until the mid-1980s. Placed in improbable locations and situations, including on clothes hangers, sticking from letter boxes and rubbish bins, and as in this work, wrapped up as parcels, Hughes’s screenprinted and painted arcs contradict the rainbow’s naturally transient, fleeting state.",
