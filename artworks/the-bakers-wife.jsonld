    "description" : "In ‘The Baker’s Wife’ Paula Rego, a Portuguese painter who now works in London, draws on the tradition of children’s storybook illustration – for example in this print the changes of scale are reminiscent of that of Lewis Carroll’s ‘Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland’. Rego uses a variety of tones to further intensify the dream-like quality of the works and the dark shadows add a new and terrifying dimension to the familiar nursery rhymes. Nursery rhymes which are traditionally for children are given a very grown-up imagery that borders on unpleasantness, particularly in this etching.",
