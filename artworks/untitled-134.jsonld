    "description" : "From 1955-56 Souter stayed for some months in Italy, near Trieste and Milan. Living on very little, she used frugal yet innovative materials and techniques, painting with aluminium bicycle paint on newspaper and kraft paper. In this work and its accompanying Untitled work also currrently on show, the white paint is applied with directness and vigour in the manner of Jackson Pollackâ€™s Action painting. Souter did not use an easel but placed her work on a table top and moved freely around it, pouring, dripping and spattering paint or brushing it on in loose strokes.",
