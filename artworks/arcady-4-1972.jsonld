    "description" : "In 1974, Scott created a series of six silk screen prints in editions of twenty-five for the retail shops of Kilkenny Design Workshops. Arcady 4 is one of the series. The shaded green geometric arcs of the print suggest flowing foliage and the natural world. The linen backgound adds to the earthiness of the work, despite its abstract form. During the 1970â€™s Scott also painted works that alluded to the elements as in his series of works titled, Pyre, Object and Fount.",
