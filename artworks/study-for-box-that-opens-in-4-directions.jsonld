    "description" : "As in the rest of his oeuvre, Craig-Martin’s work plays with geometric shapes and everyday objects with meticulous simplicity. In ‘Study for Box that Opens in 4 Directions’, the artist has used a thin crepe tape, in place of drawing media, to evoke an almost sculptural sensibility. The pure lines appear to almost construct themselves forward from the pale isometric graph, rising slightly; adding another dimension to what at first appears to be a seemingly ordinary composition.",
