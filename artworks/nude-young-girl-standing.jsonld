    "description" : "‘Nude Young Girl Standing’, 1965 is from McKenna’s earlier period. Made while the artist was in Florence and carved from a single piece of pear-wood, this still, solitary and elongated figure is rendered in a style much in contrast to his later work involving figures constructed from multiple pieces of wood and often suggesting a monumental presence or implied movement.",
