    "description" : "Claire Halpin’s practice explores themes and concepts around contested territories and histories through painting, video and installation. Iraq is part of a body of work called Jigmap Series, which attempts to navigate the complexity of the contemporary theatre of war, as battlefield expands to battlespace in the information age.
