    "description" : "The art collector Gordon Lambert commissioned this work dedicated to the mezzo soprano Bernadette Greevy as a tribute to her contribution to classical singing in Ireland. Ballagh, already popular as a witty and original portraitist, used the opportunity to produce a magical trompe l’oeil painting where Greevy is represented in a variety of ways. Her framed image in a photograph is repeated on record and cassette covers and, most unusually of all, through her voice. The spectator’s presence triggers the playing of one of Greevy’s best known recordings of songs by Brahms from a cassette player concealed behind the fictive player in the picture.",
