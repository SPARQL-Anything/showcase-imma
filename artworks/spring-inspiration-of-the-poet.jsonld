    "description" : "Spring – Inspiration of the Poet (1965) is a work by Jarman that was highly selective about the references that he would draw from his source materials. Based on the Nicholas Poussin’s work of the same title (1629), Jarman retains the main compositional features but then abandons the source, in order to use the borrowed composition as a frame within which to conduct his own painterly exploration.
