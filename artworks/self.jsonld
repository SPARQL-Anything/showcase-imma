    "description" : "During the 1960s Jones became famous for his ‘Table and Chair’, (Collection,Tate Britain) in which a call girl in provocatively sexual dress and pose is cast in the role of each piece of furniture. Although ‘Self’ is less controversial, it is equally punchy and blatantly pop in mood. The artist is absent but his presence and his interests are clearly indicated by the revealing combination of natty, man-about town tie and the lipstick smile. The use of silkscreen printing as a medium was very appealing to pop artists because of its association with advertising and commercial art.",
