    "description" : "Creating an interior where it perpetually rains, Juan Muñoz made ‘Dublin Rain Room’ for his solo exhibition at IMMA in 1994. The scale is approximately 1/5 of the architectural scale. The work poses a subject–object problem; we are afforded the position of having a total or encompassing view of a world as represented by the space of the room – however, the subject (our self) is absent.",
