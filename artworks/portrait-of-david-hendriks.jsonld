    "description" : "Robert Ballagh was one of a number of Irish artists taken on by the gallerist David Hendriks in the early 1970s. At the time, David Hendriks supported a host of avant-garde artists when the climate in Ireland was hostile to new subjects, approaches and materials. Many of the Irish artists taken on by Hendriks went on to achieve international reputations. This tribute to him was the result of a joint collaboration between Ballagh and the collector Gordon Lambert.",
