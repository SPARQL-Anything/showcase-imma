    "description" : "‘The Walls’ offers us a panoramic view of the nationalist housing estates of Derry’s Bogside taken from immediately inside the city’s historic walls. The top tier of a three-tier inscription overlaying the photograph reads ALWAYS / WITHOUT in green lettering, a colour emblematic of Nationalism; while at the bottom, in blue lettering traditionally connoting Unionism, are the words WITHIN / FOREVER. To the Nationalist population the Derry city walls signify exclusion and deprivation (both meanings of the preposition ‘WITHOUT’); whereas to the Unionist population they signify security and the preservation of a long established-order. The same image is thus viewed very differently in Northern Ireland’s riven communities.",
