    "description" : "In 1979 Souter visited Shannon Airport, where she took flying lessons and created a series of works inspired by the airport and airplanes. The paintings explore aerial divisions of the landscape viewed through the drama of local weather conditions, the grid of the airportâ€™s perimeters and runways and the curved aluminium forms of the jets. Her observations of the effects of technology on nature continued in later work arising from her travels to Kuwait in 1999 to view the desert and oil fields after the Gulf War.",
