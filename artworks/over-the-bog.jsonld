    "description" : "Souter’s vistas are not the receding, pastoral kind, but rather show small holdings and side cuttings, the left-over strips of land where detritus haphazardly gathers and nature curls its way around it. Here Souter used aluminium paint to depict the metallic light of the moment. In his The Irish Imagination Brian O’Doherty included Souter as part of a ‘particular strain of Irish artists working in an atmospheric mode …characterized by an uneasy and restless fix on the unimportant’.",
