    "dc:description" : "Collins’ style developed out of a fascination and connection with the Irish landscape. His practice would often involve detailed studies of twigs and moss. Misty hues dominate his palette, contributing to the atmospheric mood. Although Collins was primarily a landscape artist it was the concept of the land that concerned him – his work rarely related to a particular place but captures the romantic notion of a poetic Ireland. ‘The Wood Pigeon’s Nest’ perfectly encapsulates this atmospheric style. The image of nest and egg is central. The vulnerability and fragility of the nest is evoked, the subject hewn out of an abstract background.",
