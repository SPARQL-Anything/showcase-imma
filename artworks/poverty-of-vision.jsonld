    "description" : "Poverty of Vision is a drag performance that knits together intersecting critiques of the 1980’s. Considering the 80’s as a regressive period when contemporary art discourse and institutional frameworks actively forgot the radical redefinitions, of what art could be and who it could be for, that had gone before in the 1970’s. The piece proposes that ‘looking into archives is all about looking at what isn’t there’.   ",
