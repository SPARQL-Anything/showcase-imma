    "description" : "‘A Funny Thing Happened on the way to The G.P.O.’ is made from a mixture of regular wood pieces fixed together to represent two figures in a tableaux that may suggest a chance encounter on the street (“on the way to the G.P.O.”) or a captured moment in an unknown narrative between two people. The G.P.O. may suggest a more historically loaded event than simply a geographic location. Reminiscent of early Cubism, facial features and limbs are simplified and movement is suggested in the dynamic between parallel lines of wood, emphasised by painted sections.",
