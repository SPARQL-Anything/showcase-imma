    "description" : "The ‘City Drawings’ series, an ongoing project to map all the capital cities in the world, reflects Kathy Prendergast’s interest in drawing and map-making. The delicate web of lines that represent a modern city bear a remarkable resemblance to the organic patterns of veins and leaves. By subjecting all of the cities to the confines of the same size of paper, Prendergast imposes a strange sense of democracy on the world. All have an equal status, no matter how intricate or crowded they seem, and the understated pencil marks and framing device indicate that this mapping project differs from earlier maps in that its intention is the opposite of those commissioned for invading armies. This ongoing project is theoretically difficult to complete as the capital cities of the world are subject to change all the time. Prendergast was awarded the prestigious Premio 2000 prize at the Venice Biennale for the ‘City Drawing’ series in 1995.",
