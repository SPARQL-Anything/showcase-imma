    "description" : "This maquette represents the preliminary stage of what would have been one of Jocob Epstein’s last works, intended for Crown Hill Church, Plymouth. The rough treatment, exaggerated drapery and expressive arm and head gestures all have roots in earlier religious work, particularly his ‘Christ Risen’ of thirty years earlier. Working in a style described as “Expressive Naturalism”, there is a strong resemblance to medieval sculpture especially in the manner in which the drapery is rendered. The ascension theme is greatly reinforced through the angles and axes of the rising Christ, all of which point heavenward.",
