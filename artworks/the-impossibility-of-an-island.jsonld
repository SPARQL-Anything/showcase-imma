    "description" : "David Beattieâ€™s art is situated between the scientific, the human and the spiritual. His sculptures combine sound, movement and physics to create unlikely alliances. His reapplication of domestic objects and technologies offers a fresh take of their function and allows a reinterpretation of these outmoded objects. David is an artist who is deeply interested in concepts around materialism and object-orientated philosophy spear-headed by Heidegger and Graham Harman. ",
