    "description" : "Souter was awarded an Italian Government Scholarship in 1958 and painted Chioggia that year. Already her work is characterized by a strong sense of individuality. Not liking the texture of canvas, she worked in a variety of media on paper laid on board. This work shows a transition that perhaps gestures towards certain innovations of Fontana in his Gessi or chalk works where he sought to develop new forms in art appropriate to the contemporary age.",
