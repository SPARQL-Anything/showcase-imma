    "description" : "This work is part of the Street series which follows Jordan’s interrogation of the urban, mainly focussing on European cities. This work shows a streetscape in Dublin. Although there are recognisable scenes in this work, there is nothing familiar or reassuring in the method of their capture. Whether it is the darkness of a February afternoon, the reflected light of a fresh snowfall, or the distinctive hue of Halogen Street lights, her paintings are charged with content that is either to come, or else is taking place just out of view.",
