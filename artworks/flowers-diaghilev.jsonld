    "description" : "As the title suggests, this etching by American artist Elizabeth Peyton is a still life arrangement of a vase of flowers in full bloom and a book connected with the Ballets Russes founder Sergei Diaghilev. Also present on the book’s cover is the name Boris Kochno, a dancer, friend, collaborator and lover of Diaghilev. Inspired by poetry, literature, interiors and photographs, this edition was based on a work from Peyton’s solo exhibition at IMMA in 2009",
