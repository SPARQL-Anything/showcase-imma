    "description" : "‘Preserve’ features non-functioning, spent light bulbs which often appear as emblematic objects in Wentworth’s sculpture. A similar work, titled ‘Saving Daylight’, 1984, points to an interest in how time is manipulated by the use of artificial light. In ‘Preserve’ the cast concrete cap suggests a desire to keep or halt time – but the heavy ceiling suspended above the delicate glass globes also threatens to destroy. The title ‘Preserve’ also plays on the American term for jam which is a slang word for a predicament.",
