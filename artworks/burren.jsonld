    "description" : "Works such as ‘Standing Stones’ and ‘Burren’, are related to the colour field paintings by artists such as Mark Rothko and Barrett Newman, but without losing reference to experience or actual space. These paintings were also made by pouring paint over wetted canvas, with straight architectural lines created by using masking tape that was removed after the poured paint had settled. The dark colours of these works are not naturalistic, and their spaces are deep and ambiguous, though segmented or conceptualised by the vertical lines.",
