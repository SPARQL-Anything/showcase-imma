    "dc:description" : "In 2002 Patrick Jolley was commissioned to make a film in Dublin’s north-side suburb of Ballymun – an area targeted for radical social and economic change due to Dublin City Council’s plan to regenerate the area by demolishing and rebuilding residential housing and services. As part of this plan, residents were requested to move from flats in tower blocks, which in many cases were their lifetime dwellings, to new contemporary houses. Jolley filmed the interior of Shangan, an empty four-storey building, which was awaiting demolition and in collaboration with German artist, Rebecca Trost and Norwegian artist/animator, Lise Inger Hansen, combined real-time and animated footage.",
