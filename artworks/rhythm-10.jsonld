    "dc:description" : "In ‘Rhythm 10’ Abramović placed her left hand with fingers spread on a large scroll of white paper. She then took one of ten knives positioned in front of her and began to rhythmically stab the spaces between her fingers. Each time the artist accidently cut her skin she took a new knife. Abramović continued the performance until she had been wounded 20 times. Having made an audio recording of this process, she then played back the recording and repeated her actions, trying to match new cuts with the original ones.",
