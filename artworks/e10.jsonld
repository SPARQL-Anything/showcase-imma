    "description" : "In contrast to the aesthetic of controlled restraint which dominate Patrick Scott’s oeuvre, the Gestural Drawings such as ‘E 10’ and ‘E 13’ appear to be the outcome of spontaneous and impulsive actions. Executed by whipping ink onto paper using a ‘wand’ made from fabric fastened to a cane, the Gestural Drawings demand to be considered in terms of the circumstances in which they were made. Documentations of physical movement, these drawings were produced intermittently over a period of many years at Scott’s restored farmhouse and studio in Ballynabrocky, Co. Wicklow.",
