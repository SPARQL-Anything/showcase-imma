    "description" : "Invited by IMMAâ€™s founding Director Declan McGonagle, in 1994 Sol LeWitt proposed a series of wall drawings for the Baroque Chapel in the North Range. They were to be painted directly onto the wall above the oak paneling where the vibrant colours would echo the stained glass windows. As permanent interventions in the fabric of the building were not permitted, the proposal was not realized.",
