    "description" : "Other Men’s Flowers is a portfolio of text-based prints by fifteen London artists curated by Joshua Compston (1970-96) and published by The Paragon Press. Compston took the title, Other Men’s Flowers, from an anthology of wartime poetry compiled by Field-Marshal Viscount Wavell (1883-1950). Don Brown’s contribution to Other Men’s Flowers is a list of categories separated by semi-colons, derived from a running list Brown has been compiling on his computer for several years. The categories include general groups, activities and occupations or professions. The small scale text is printed by monotype in a narrow column centered on the page.",
