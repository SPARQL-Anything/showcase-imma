    "description" : "Scott’s love of gold ground was fostered on journeys to Venice and Ravenna in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Arguably his signature expression, his Gold paintings are an absolutely modern revivifying of the art of formalistic meditative sign. Like the stylized ancient arts of the East or the art of the Eastern Orthodox icon makers, the spare elegance and symmetry of his Gold paintings lends to limitless repetition and renewal within a set of invariable rules. ‘Gold Painting 34’ demonstrates the enduring and emblematic power of Scott’s work in gold leaf and tempera on raw canvas, where rectilinear bands of gold bisect the picture plane, repeated across 4 ’tiles’ stacked together.",
