    "description" : "One of the most prominent figurative painters in Ireland in the 1950s and 1960s, Patrick Hennessy responded to the repressive climate of Ireland in the mid-twentieth century. Despite the presence of surreal elements in his work Hennessy’s interests were quite different to those of the European Surrealist movement, more political than Giorgio de Chirico &amp; René Magritte.",
