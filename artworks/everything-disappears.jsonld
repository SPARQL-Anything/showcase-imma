    "description" : "Everything Disappears revolves around four people from Taiwan who answered a call to participate in the film, which would explore ideas of self-image, performance and identity on screen. Portrayals of the four participants unravel across intimate scenes to surreal staged events, mediating an exchange between reality, reconstruction and mythological imagination.",
