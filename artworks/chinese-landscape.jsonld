    "description" : "Scott produced a number of landscapes following a visit to China in the mid 1980s. ‘Chinese Landscape’ is a stylized representation of unusual rock formations in the Guelin region, whose shapes Scott has presented in contour like lines of white tempera on raw canvas, as though viewed through a veil, above which the gold disc of the sun hovers.",
