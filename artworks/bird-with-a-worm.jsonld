    "description" : "While Hall painted a number of views of Achill Island and Connemara, dreamscapes including fish, birds and natural phenomena form the basis for most of the works by Hall in the IMMA Collection. In Dublin, Hall discovered a shop which sold unusual carved toys and birds from India and these influenced his style. In works such as Bird with a Worm, forms are abstracted and pattern-like in quality, with overlapping layers of colour in which shapes are outlined by lines incised in the colour.",
