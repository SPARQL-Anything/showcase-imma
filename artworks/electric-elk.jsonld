    "description" : "For Cooke the elk represented a powerful symbol of pre-civilised consciousness. In this painting the elk emerges majestically from the gloomy bog land with its enormous antlers treated like massive antennae transmitting, as it were, a message from the past. The elk yielded up by the bog, demonstrates the process of perpetual interchange that occurs in life which Cooke believes forces us into a confrontation with what is real.",
