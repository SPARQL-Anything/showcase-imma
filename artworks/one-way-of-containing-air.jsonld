    "description" : "Co-founder of the National Sculpture Factory, Cork, Maud Cotter’s early reputation was established as a stained-glass artist. Cotter sought to redress the decorative and religious stereotypes that tended to preclude this medium’s acceptance as a fine art discipline. A visit to Iceland in 1991 precipitated a renewed interest in sculptural practice which she has pursued exclusively since then, working with such diverse media as steel, glass, perspex, cardboard, wax and latex.",
