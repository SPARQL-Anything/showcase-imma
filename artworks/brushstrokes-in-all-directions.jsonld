    "description" : "LeWitt brought his conceptual aesthetic to every medium he explored, from sculpture to wall drawing, to his prolific work as a printmaker. Prints and portfolios were a very productive vehicle for the artist to explore his core strategies and became integral to his overall approach. ‘Brushstrokes in All Directions’, 1994, is an example of his later more fluid, curving forms and overlapping rich hues, here shimmering through a diaphanous interlace of dark paint. He completed almost 300 editioned print projects and more than fifty artist’s books.",
