    "description" : "Architect, sculptor, painter, typographer, draftsman, curator and professor, Max Bill’s work is characterised by clarity of design and precise proportions. He sought to create forms which visually represented the New Physics of the early 20th century creating objects that enabled sensory understanding. His sculptural works demonstrate his extraordinary skills of geometric abstraction. Bill’s theoretical writing and progressive works were highly influential on Swiss graphic design in the 1950s and he was known as the founder of Concretism (Concrete Art).",
