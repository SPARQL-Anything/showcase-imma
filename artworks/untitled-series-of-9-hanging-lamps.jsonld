    "description" : "This hanging lamp is one of a series of 9 created on the occasion of the first major solo exhibition in Ireland by the Cuban-American artist Jorge Pardo. Pardo is among the first generation of artists to utilise fully the advancement in computer technologies to explore virtual spaces, utopias and the boundaries of museum spaces. Using the language of architecture and design to engage with fine art, Pardo’s practice intertwines various disciplines to renovate everyday objects, homes and museum spaces into something new that draws the viewer into an active spectatorship. Pardo operates at once inside and outside of the art world. He views art largely through the perspective of design and architecture, and making no hierarchical distinctions between his paintings, sculptures, installations, buildings or lamps. Equally important is the framework within which his works are seen, be that a museum, café or domestic interior.",
