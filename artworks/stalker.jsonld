    "description" : "Eva Rothschild’s sculptures have been compared to artefacts from a lost civilisation. ‘Stalker’ is a case in point, its distinct modernist lines subverted by its suggested drama of esoteric rituals. As the title suggests, ‘Stalker’ alludes to ideas of a dark presence prowling in the shadows. It also brings to mind Andrei Tarkovsky’s sci-fi film epic of the same name. Tarkovsky’s film ‘Stalker’ is a journey into a remote forbidden territory devastated by an unnamed event that has reputed otherworldly powers to grant one’s deepest desires.",
