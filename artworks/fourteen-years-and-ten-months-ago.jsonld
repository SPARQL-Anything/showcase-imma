    "description" : "Byrne’s work questions how images are constructed, transmitted and mediated. From his ‘In the News Series’, the title of this work changes each time it is exhibited. This highlights how photographic media at once captures the zeitgeist, and is simultaneously subject to time and obsolescence; evidenced by the self-dated magazines in the scene. This series comments on the dissemination of information, photography and reality – and truth.",
