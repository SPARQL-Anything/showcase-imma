    "description" : "‘Logo’ involves the transformation of an abandoned office letter tray, by filling the spaces that once held paper with cast concrete. While this may have something to do with Wentworth’s admission of having no aptitude for organising paperwork the result is that a slim piece of office furniture has become a formidable block. According to Wentworth, the strip of tyre on which it sits, once released from its regular enclosed circular form ‘acts a bit like an animal, flipping about, having a life of its own when you try and handle it’.",
