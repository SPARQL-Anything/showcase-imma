    "description" : "A 2.7 metre high work of layered cloth, paint and twine, ‘Stack’ suggests an archaeological sense of both space and time. It refers to the landscape, a concern also demonstrated in Prendergast’s ‘Map’ series’ of 1983 and 1995. This sculpture’s form, both weighty and light, bulky and fragile, is marked by a sense of perfection and delicate beauty, whilst at the same time confounding our expectations. The association with the off-cuts from clothing factories kept afloat by women’s labour makes a further link between woman and landscape.",
