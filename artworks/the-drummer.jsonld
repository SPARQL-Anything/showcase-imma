    "description" : "While Barry Flanagan has also made sculptures of other animals, such as elephants and horses, he is best known for his triumphant leaping and dancing hares. Flanaganâ€™s sculptures are by no means restricted by the use of this repeated motif; each hare being unique with its own dynamic gesture. Always celebratory and life-affirming, they dance, use technical equipment, engage in sports and, as we see here, play musical instruments. ",
