    "description" : "Make Believe all this Winter reflects Souter’s fascination with the circus and clowns. ‘There is a certain poignancy to clowning’, she has observed, and the mood is simultaneously humorous and sad. Her composition has just the right measure of flatness, both in colour and texture. During this period her palette was muted with a preponderance of shades of yellow, white and cream and green.",
