    "description" : "Working with film and slide projection, Irvine creates disjointed narratives which frustrate by offering fragmented clues and alternative viewpoints that can be read in a variety of ways, challenging the idea of a single coherent meaning. ‘Margaret Again’ is a film installation based on the book ‘In Watermelon Sugar’ by Richard Brautigan (1978). Irvine creates a scenario where Margaret, a spurned lover in the book, encounters her double and engages in a silent dialogue drawn from the 1939 film ‘An Awful Truth’ by Leo McCarey. The action is accompanied by a Stravinsky waltz.",
