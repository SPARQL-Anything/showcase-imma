    "description" : "This ongoing series of over 70 paintings entitled Moment of Surrender is based on a script by Lalor, tells a story about a single father in his early thirties and his two young children trying to make ends meet in a post economical crash, in an almost unrecognizable Dublin.  The idea of moving becomes a constant element in Lalor’s work, whether it being through choice or through desperation.
