    "description" : "This recent work by The Otolith Group invokes a transhistorical realm that explores the Black Lives Matter movement, successive Immigration Policies of the Tory government in Britain, the Windrush generation, the Anthropocene, geology and black feminist cosmologies. Atmospheric and rhythmic, the video brings together dance, performance, music, recital, and digital animation to compose a work in which the unpayable debts of racial capitalism cannot be separated from the ongoing crimes of climate catastrophe.
