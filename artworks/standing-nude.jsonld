    "description" : "In this painting a controlling line and a restricted tonality contains the body. ‘Standing Nude’ relates to Scott’s interest in Palaeolithic art and is evocative of a primal eroticism. It can also be linked to a small number of sculptures of the female nude that Scott made from cast concrete in the 1950s.",
