    "description" : "Commissioned for an installation at Smith College in 1995, ‘Big Silver’ is attached to a motorised pulley so that it rises and subsides at regular intervals, mimicking the ballet dancer’s pliés at the bar. At its lowest point on the floor it is a formless expanse of glittering fabric, but it reveals its true identity as it is pulled up the wall, the figurative emerges from the abstract and vice versa.",
