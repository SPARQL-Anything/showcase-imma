    "description" : "“For many years Joyce hovered over Irish Literature, in a smothering sort of way. He’s now long gone, but he’s very much part of Irish consciousness, I do feel, to this day. Even though among younger people he has been displaced by Beckett, but the music of ‘The Wake’, and the music of the language and the compound works and the associations they set off, the vectors that fly out from every page of ‘The Wake’, fascinated me as they did anyone else. So I wanted to do a piece about him in which I didn’t lie down under him, but challenged him a little bit. So I created this very complex little box, full of these four sided cubes, in something like these twenty honeycombs that they can be placed and taken out of, to read exactly each of these texts. But when you take them out and replace them randomly in the honeycomb of the box, you invent a new language, and everybody puts them in differently, and I’ve tried it with some poets etc., some people make something out of it according to their nature and desire. So it was making a new language of ‘The Wake’. So I called it ‘In the Wake of…'”*",
