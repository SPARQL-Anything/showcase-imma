    "description" : "The urban environment represents a particular focus for the artist Julian Opie. Borrowing idioms and images from everyday life, he re-interprets and plays with our notions of the ordinary. In ‘Escaped Animals’, Opie produced a series of thirteen road signs, each depicting an individual animal. Each animal, (including a fox, squirrel, sheep and cat) has been represented as an outline shape against a different coloured background.",
