    "description" : "Paul Nugent’s art is located in the ambivalent areas of past and present; multiplicity and uniqueness; presence and absence. Working in series, from the earlier ‘Six Sisters’ to this ‘Cardinal’ series of seven, Nugent paints a single ecclesiastical figure in a manner that evokes earlier Dutch and Renaissance art. Starting from a single photograph, the artist draws the figure on gessoed board over which acrylic paint is applied followed by washes of colour and glazes. The paintings appear as single colourfield abstract paintings at first glance and only reveal their contents over time.",
