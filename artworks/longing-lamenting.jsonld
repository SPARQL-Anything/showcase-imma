    "dc:description" : "Dohertyâ€™s work deals with the images of the landscape which surround us, often these images are constructed or staged by tourist boards and in advertisements where the landscape provides a backdrop. The fact that these images are taken by people who do not necessarily inhabit that landscape, such as photojournalists, and that this constructed depiction of the landscape is often imbued with a romantic or poetic notion which we seem all too eager to indulge is something which Doherty explores throughout his practice.",
