    "description" : "Camille Souter is one of Ireland most prolific artists whose painting hovers between abstraction and figuration. ‘Old Wheel Gate Entrance to Estate’ is characteristic of Souter’s work: small in scale and highly expressive. Her tones are muted and mysterious and the layering of paint suggests depth and hidden riches. Although Souter’s work appears abstract it is firmly rooted in experience. Thus even the most random marks may indicate the direction of a bird or a plane in full flight.",
