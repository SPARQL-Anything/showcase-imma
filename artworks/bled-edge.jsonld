    "description" : "Alastair MacLennan’s vision is profoundly humane. His subject matter is often grim – division and conflict being his principal themes, his persona while performing often appears equally sinister, though he conveys a deep sense of empathy, kindness and caring through obviously considered and precise movement. Throughout his practice each performance is directly related to the specific location and space rarely re staging the work. ",
