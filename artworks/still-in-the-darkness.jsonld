    "description" : "dreams and moods that subside in a few weeks are a series of hand-tufted rugs and small ceramic pieces which were made for Al-Sabah’s solo exhibition at Solstice Arts Centre in Navan in 2019. Although a new medium for Al-Sabah, these continue his ongoing engagement with materials and the hand-made. In many presentations of his work, sculptural objects are presented alongside the CGI films positioning the idea of both as hand-made or crafted. ",
