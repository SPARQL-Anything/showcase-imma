    "description" : "‘Untitled’, 2001, is one of a suite of seven heads, each unique, made from a soft pink material, originally one of the artist’s jackets. Autobiography and identity have been important influences on the artist’s practice, as have her family connections with furniture and tapestry making. The steel and glass vitrine is an integral part of the sculpture, which Bourgeois described as a cell. It mimics a Museum display case, acting as support to the disembodied head.",
