    "description" : "In ‘Curvas Inmateriales’, movement is generated by air currents so delicate that the presence of a moving spectator is enough to activate it, giving the viewer an active role in the artwork. In addition to movement, Soto also realised that the surrounding light conditions have a powerful effect on our perception of the art object. To maximise the potential of this, in ‘Curvas Inmateriales’ the lengths of curved wire in suspended motion are painted in yellow and white and presented against a ground of thin black and white lines, appearing immaterial and magical. Gordon Lambert bought Curvas Inmateriales, directly from the artist’s Paris studio in 1967. It was the only artwork from an Irish collection to be included in the first Rosc exhibition held in Dublin the same year.",
