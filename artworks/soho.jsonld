    "description" : "“I painted ‘Soho’ during the summer of 1994. I started, as I usually do, with what Turner referred to as ‘colour beginnings’. The mood and character was set by painting the whole canvas with dark blues, predominantly ultramarine. This was drawn into freely, wet into wet, with green, crimson, darker and lighter blues and white. I then use sheets of painted paper to develop the space of the painting – like Matisse did with his collages. When I feel I’ve located a group of colours, I take a polaroid, remove the paper and carry out the painting.",
