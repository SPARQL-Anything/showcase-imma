    "description" : "Texts, written and sung, anchor “I reached inside myself through time” (2015), a multi-media installation work by Dennis McNulty specially commissioned for the group exhibition LIAF 2015: Disappearing Acts, curated by Matt Packer and Arne Skaug Olsen. McNulty’s installation has its origins in a chance encounter with an autographed image of Morten Harket, singer with Norwegian pop band A-ha, while on a site visit to Svolvær, a town in the remote and rugged Lofoten archipelago in northern Norway where LIAF (Lofoten International Art Festival) takes place biannually.",
