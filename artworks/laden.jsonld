    "dc:description" : "Eilís O’Connell is an Irish sculptor living and working in London. Her sculpture ‘Laden’ was purchased by the Museum from her 1999 solo show in the Green on Red Gallery, Dublin. In this sculpture, she explores a familiar theme. The organic and totem-like references of the object, which are a regular feature of her work, are emphasized here by the organic nature of the material and the way in which it was made. Pinched out in multiple pleated folds, from wax resin, the work retains the feel of the artist’s hand. The folds accentuate the overall organic shape and give a sense that the piece has grown slowly – they could be compared to the concentric annual rings on a tree trunk or the ridges on a human fingerprint.",
