    "description" : "Using gravitational force as a starting point, this sculpture reads downwards and is undercut at floor-level to achieve minimum contact with the ground at its base. While referencing a memorial, ‘Stele XI’ is a hand-carved meditative work created in response to material, which speaks of the importance of craftsmanship. Warren says, ‘I particularly enjoy the timber-vaulted roofs sometimes discovered in old barns or churches; I enjoy dry-stone walls, hand carved headstones, a chair that ‘stands’ well – objects made from traditional skills, finely honed over generations’.",
