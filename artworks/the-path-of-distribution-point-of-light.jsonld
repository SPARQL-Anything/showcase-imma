    "description" : "McIntyre is interested in drawing relationships between the spaces she depicts in her photographic images and the gallery spaces these images inhabit. For this installation, The Path to the Distribution Point of Light, she has constructed a low platform, in the form of a shallow ramp that spills out from the corner of the room. The stage-like structure introduces a sense of heightened theatricality as you are invited to walk across it to view the photograph on the wall.",
