    "description" : "In 1972 Ballagh began his ‘People at an Exhibition’ series, an extensive body of paintings of people looking at paintings by international artists such as Mondrian, Warhol, Jasper Johns and many others, as well as Irish artists such as Michael Farrell, Patrick Scott and Cecil King. The work in Ballagh’s ‘Two Men and a Lichtenstein’ suggests one of Lichtenstein’s ‘Brushstrokes’ series (1965-66).",
