    "description" : "Painted late in his career, this is a version of the artist’s earlier work of the same title and style from 1924. De Chirico made a number of these self-forgeries as a back-lash against criticism of his later style. It builds on ‘St. Sebastian’ and ‘The Martydom of St. Sebastian’, paintings by Antonello da Messina and Andrea Mantegna respectively. The Christian martyr is depicted transitioning between two worlds, strewn with arrows and tied to an architectural column. De Chirico’s figure is part flesh, part articulated artist’s model, and arrows are represented by angular drawing tools.",
