    "description" : "Cake Bomb is part of a series called Fragments of a Lost Civilisation, which continues Lynch’s longstanding engagement with discourses on identity, appropriation and re-appropriation, hidden histories and queer culture. This series of cyanotypes prints engage with methodologies and approaches that respond to the history of mechanical reproduction, digital reproduction online, the persistent circulation of images in the public domain, all the while querying our relationship with the image, its consumption, distribution, reproduction, value and forcing (re)considerations of authenticity within art.   ",
