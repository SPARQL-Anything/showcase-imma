    "description" : "The brutalisation of civil society in Belfast during decades of political unrest is the focus of much of Paul Seawrightâ€™s photographic work. The thoughtful and disquieting images which he produces probe beyond stereotypical images of conflict, in a way that is exploratory rather than merely documentary. The camera is used as an investigative tool rather than one to describe and record an event.",
