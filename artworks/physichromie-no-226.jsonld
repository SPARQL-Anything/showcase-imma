    "description" : "As a student Carlos Cruz-Diez studied Josef Albers’s research into colour and optics. Since 1959, he has applied his knowledge of the physics of colour and vision to produce numerous ‘Physichromies’, pieces whose colours appear to change when viewed from different angles. By applying thin strips of metal and coloured stripes of plastic onto painted colour lines, Cruz-Diez achieved a moiré-like effect, generating countless colour variations according to the movement of the viewer and intensity of the light.",
