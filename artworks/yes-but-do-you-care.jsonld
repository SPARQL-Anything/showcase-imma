    "description" : "This work explores the right to make a bad decision amid issues of personal autonomy, family caregiving and Ireland’s new capacity legislation. Visual artist Marie Brett developed this work through an extensive participatory project with members of the Dementia Carers Campaign Network and contextual advisors in law and human rights. Further collaboration with chorographer/dancer Philip Connaughton resulted in a series of collaborative, cross-medium art pieces. An in-progress element of this work was first shown at The People’s Pavilion at IMMA, August 2020.",
