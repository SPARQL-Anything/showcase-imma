    "description" : "No Title (2016) is an expansive project by Sarah Pierce that considers the condition of dementia in relation to the protocols of art making. Anchored in a series of modestly produced videos No Title actively questions the ethics of representation, and the limitations of clinical discourse in re-thinking subject-hood around dementia. Filming in her family home, and assisted by her niece operating camera, Pierce intimately guides her parents through a series of table-top exercises she developed, that speak of art-making, of habitude, of domesticity, but also unflinchingly of memory, of loss, and profound familial love. No Title pictures the painful process of renegotiating familial relations surrounding ‘the dementia subject’. When concepts like mother / daughter / husband are no longer reciprocated how do we relinquish our most primal bonds in the absence of terms to describe these radical new relations? ",
