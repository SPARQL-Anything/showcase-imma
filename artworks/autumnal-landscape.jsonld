    "description" : "In 1960 Scott began using tempera on unprimed canvas, soaking, tilting and manipulating the plane of the support to achieve poured, dripped and pooling effects. His process was particularly inspired by the marshy landscape and glinting lakes of the midlands. ‘Autumnal Landscape’ palpably evokes the turning season, where green gives way to shades of gold and orange.",
