    "description" : "Ciarán Murphy’s enigmatic paintings such as L-2 take their starting point from a wide-ranging and ever growing archive of images, found, collected and carefully arranged into categories by the artist. This unseen archive forms the backbone that haunts the finished works. Through a process of editing, erasing, overwriting or simply replacing what has been painted and unpainted, the work leaves a sense that is not quite of loss, or absence, but rather the presence of a non-thing.",
