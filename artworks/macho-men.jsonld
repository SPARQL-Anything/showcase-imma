    "description" : "This work is part of the Reminiscence series, which explores memory and representation. About these works McDonagh has said: “Up until now many depictions of the Travelling community have been sensationalist and stereotypical which tends to fuel the negative relations between both settled and Travelling communities.  As a Traveller myself I want people to see the everyday realities of those who are usually misinterpreted by an outsider’s view, a view which is inaccurate and alarming.  The work that I create aims to be both subtle and contemplative, hoping to draw the viewer in, inviting them to explore and discover for themselves.  I achieve this by capturing images that are hazy and whimsical in their appearance, images that need to be explored and questioned in order to be understood.” In these a slow exposure creates an abstraction taking the focus off the actual person and creating a more general narrative representative of the community.",
