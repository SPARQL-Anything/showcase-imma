    "description" : "After spending some thirty years as an unofficial artist behind the Iron Curtain, Ilya Kabakov first came to the attention of the West in the 1980s. Today Kabakov, who is known as ‘The father of Moscow Conceptualism’, is seen to be one of the most important Russian artists to have emerged in the late 20th century. Alternating between light-hearted irony and genuine tragedy, Kabakov’s work often evokes a shadowy world in which fable-like miracles might occur. ",
