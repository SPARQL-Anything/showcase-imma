    "description" : "During the late 1960s, Scott combined squares of gold leaf, white tempera and acrylic paint on raw linen canvas to create geometric images in infinite permutations. ‘Gold Painting 47’ is a fine example of Scott’s ability to absorb and adapt signs and symbols across a number of mediums. The geometric disc is reminiscent of the the glowing orbs of his earlier Device series while the golden lines below suggest the structural forms in his later Pyre series.",
