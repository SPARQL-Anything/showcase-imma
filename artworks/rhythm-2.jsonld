    "description" : "‘Rhythm 2’ was a two part performance undertaken by Marina Abramović in 1974. Wishing to test the state of unconsciousness as part of performance, Abramović first took a pill usually prescribed for catatonia, a condition which causes extreme motor immobility. Reacting violently to the medication she experienced seizures and involuntary muscle movement. Though unable to control her body, Abramović remained lucid and could observe what was happening to her physically.",
