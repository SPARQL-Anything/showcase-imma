    "description" : "Shot in Connemara in 1962 while he was a student at Yale, this is Michael Craig-Martin’s only film to date. It captures the essence of the landscape in a style that would colour the rest of his career. The seemingly basic approach echoes the starkness and stillness of the Irish countryside, while transcending the daily experiences featured in the work. Assumed lost or destroyed, the artist’s daughter re-discovered the film in 2000, it was donated to IMMA by the artist in 2005.",
