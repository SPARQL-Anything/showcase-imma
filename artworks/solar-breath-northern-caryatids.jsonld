    "description" : "Filmed using a digital camera, ‘Solar Breath (Northern Caryatids)’ is a continuation of Snow’s longstanding interest in perception, optics and natural phenomena. Sucked outwards from the interior of the artist’s Northern Ontario cabin by a Solar Wind, a curtain becomes violently flattened against a fly-screen in a naturally looping action as though the house is breathing. Projected directly onto the gallery wall, the image is the actual scale of the window. ‘Caryatids’ refers to an architectural support, traditionally sculpted in the form of a draped female figure.",
