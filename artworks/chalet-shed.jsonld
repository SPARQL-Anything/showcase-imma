    "description" : "Dimitri Tsykalov is a Paris-based Russian artist. In 2003, he participated in the Artistsâ€™ Residency Programme at IMMA. During that time, he collected scrap wood from skips around the grounds of the Museum to build a fictional wooden sports car in the shape of a Porsche 911. Trees felled in the Phoenix Park became the wheels and bumper of this static speed machine.",
