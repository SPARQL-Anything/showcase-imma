    "description" : "‘Parachute’ by Dorothy Cross is a comment on loss and remembrance. A gannet, its beak near the ground, hangs upside down from a parachute suspended from the ceiling. Through the recuperation of the remainders of natural physical surroundings – a washed up gannet on Ireland’s Atlantic coast, Cross’ work both returns its animal protagonist to its former existence and presents a composition pertaining contemporaneously to the incidental and the highly careful assemblage. If, however, Parachute evokes former selves, it also appears to stem from a highly subtle sense of loss, where the accident – the artwork, the gannet’s death – is both recalled and forever relinquished.",
