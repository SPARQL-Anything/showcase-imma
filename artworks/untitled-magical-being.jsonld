    "description" : "UNTITLED (MAGICAL BEING), 2018 consists of a welded assembly of brass rods resembling a scaffolding constructed around a found object that hoists an accumulation of twisted braided saffron fabric referred to as ‘Rubia 5m wide’ used in the ubiquitous and often sacred practice of turban tying in South Asia. Rajinder’s practice is dedicated to the vulnerability of the body and its pain, hidden behind the gestures and movements of worship. His sculptures reflect his enquiries into the power of ritual action in the construction of the social body and the ways the human body unfolds around various topographic and symbolic borders.",
