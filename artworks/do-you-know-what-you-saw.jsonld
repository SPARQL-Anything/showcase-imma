    "description" : "A journey by the artist aged 19, to see a performance of Wagner’s ‘Parsifal’ in Bayreuth, and a later re-tracing of that journey, led to a series of paintings depicted in ‘Do you know what you saw?’ as a projected slide-show. A theatre structure functions as a threshold to another reality; the (incomplete) slide narrative is intended to prompt the imagination of the viewer, further amplified by the use of music. Vickery’s deceptively simple painting technique adds to the overall air of enchantment in this piece.",
