    "description" : "Nigel Rolfe lives and works in Ireland. Since the late 1970s he has developed an international reputation as a performance artist. His practice also encompasses installation, drawing, photography, video and audio media. Rolfe‘s work explores the influence of history on the individual through aesthetic gestures wrought by his body’s interaction with visceral materials such as blood, milk, rope, flour and bogwater.",
