    "description" : "Kathakers: Take a Bow I is part of a series of sculptures inspired by a dance called Kathak. Kathak dance originated from the travelling bards of North India who are referred to as Kathakars or storytellers. The Kathakars communicate stories through rhythmic foot movements, hand gestures, facial expressions, and eye work, as a form of sign language. Chooramun incorporated these expressive dance movements into the sculptures.  ",
