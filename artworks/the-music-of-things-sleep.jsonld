    "description" : "“Drawing has always been a part of what I do, and it has never played a secondary role. I do not employ drawing as a plan or a sketch for a finished piece. I am very interested in scale and its effect on our relationship to and understanding of art. I try to address the scale of the space in which I work and the spaces in which my work is shown. When I was on residence at IMMA in 1996 my drawings grew and grew until I finished up with three giant ‘Ombre’ drawings, which mirrored the very tall walls of my studio there. I worked in the natural light at IMMA and consequently like to show the ‘Ombre’s in a kind of dull light so that they loom or float before us. They often work in a ‘tromp l’oeil’ way, in that you are not sure whether they are objects or openings in the wall. I like this lack of surety. ",
