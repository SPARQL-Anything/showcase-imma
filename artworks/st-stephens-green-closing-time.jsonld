    "dc:description" : "This painting was created towards the end of Yeats’s career when his style had become very loose and dynamic. The painting depicts two figures sitting on a bench in St. Stephen’s Green at twilight. One appears to be sitting on the arm of the bench while the other squats beside them. The eminent closure of the park indicated by the title contrasted with the demeanour of the seated figures to create a sense of tension and expectancy within the work. ",
