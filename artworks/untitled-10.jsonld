    "description" : "This carborundum embossed print with gold leaf was made by Patrick Scott in collaboration with Stoney Road Press. He began to work with Stoney Road Press in the early 2000s, and as his ambitions within the medium grew, he built up a vocabulary capable of articulating the subtleties of the prints he was developing. Drawing on motifs from his paintings, Scottâ€™s print works with Stoney Road Press were a continuation of the interests and themes he explored throughout his career. The gold leaf was applied by hand to each print, allowing for the gold to function, as in his paintings, not just as a colour but as a reflector of light.",
