    "description" : "Candida Höfer’s un-peopled interiors describe a selection of formal, public and cultural spaces, including palaces, libraries and museums, in cities such as Paris, Venice, Prague and New York. This photograph of the Great Hall at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, now home to IMMA, was made by the artist while visiting Dublin in 2004 in preparation for her first solo exhibition in Ireland which took place at IMMA in 2006. During this time Höfer also photographed the National Library of Ireland, Marsh’s Library and the Long Room in the Old Library of Trinity College.",
