    "description" : "Mark Manders’s sculptures relate oddly to other sculptures of the human being because they suggest an otherness, which sets them apart from the human, Indeed they suggest the very images which ‘early’ man set on altars and began to worship. They might well be gods, hybrids, which might return us to Pompeii or to Chartres; to the final ‘pose’ of a dog caught in the ash showers of Vesuvius for to a Christian knight, waiting for resurrection.",
