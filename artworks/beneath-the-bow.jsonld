    "dc:description" : "Gravity to Michael Warren is a simple fact of life, but the manner in which he defies it with his monumental sculptures is far from simple, in spite of their spare appearance. The appropriation of a specific place, a dominant feature of late twentieth century art, by the integration of urban or rural landscapes with his sculptures, has always been Warren’s concern. The strength of his work lies in his ability to combine one or more autonomous elements in such a manner that each has its own tension, rhythm and relationship to the other, all effected with a great economy of means.
