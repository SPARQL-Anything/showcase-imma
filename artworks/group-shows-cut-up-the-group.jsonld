    "description" : "Les Levineâ€™s conceptual practice is realised in various formats including painting, photography, print, installation and, as exemplified in this work, Mail Art. This modified photograph and the accompanying humorous letter, were sent to colleagues and acquaintances of the artist, denouncing the merits of group exhibitions. The photograph was taken by Levine, and presents legendary artistic and literary collaborators William Burroughs and Brion Gysin. Burroughs and Gysin are noted for having developed the cut-up technique, employing this system to create literary, audio, and visual compositions. Levine adopts various tactics in the dissemination of his artworks and is particularly recognised for his billboard works. Informed by the language of mass advertising, this photograph uses the same aesthetic strategy, with its punchy slogan and solid typeface.",
