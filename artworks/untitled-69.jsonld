    "description" : "‘Untitled’ is one of a series of large to medium scale bronze sculptures by Tony Cragg, the forms of which are derived from scientific laboratory vessels. The work has a singular element taking the form of a glass bottle or flask and reveals Cragg’s ongoing interest in science and technology and the world of manufacturing. This is expressed by the use of a diversity of materials with a conventional commitment to sculptures as objects complete in themselves.",
