    "description" : "Gerard Byrne’s ‘New Sexual Lifestyles’ is an installation comprising a filmed re-enactment of the transcript of a panel discussion, published in Playboy magazine in 1973. The unnaturally ordered dialogue, which appears in print, is re-enacted and presented on three monitors programmed to shuffle the sequence of the discussion, building an element of chance, slippage or error into the work, and removing a single linear narrative. The setting of the re-enactment is a late modernist building in Co. Wicklow: the Goulding Summer House. Large photographs of the architecture and the view from inside the house physically and conceptually frame the installation; at once suggestive of voyeurism and alluding to the openness of the dialogue. A photograph of the exterior of the house shows the lush natural surrounding landscape, contrasting the natural with the built environment.",
