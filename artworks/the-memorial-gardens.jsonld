    "description" : "Made in 2008 while participating in IMMA’s Artist Residency Programme, ‘The Memorial Gardens’ by Niamh O’Malley is an installation projecting footage, taken at the National War Memorial Gardens in Islandbridge, Dublin, projected onto oil on etched-primed aluminium. O’Malley is interested in the fabricated nature of the viewing experience. Her artistic practice, which often takes the form of video projections onto painted canvases, is concerned with the distance from source to spectacle, the deliberate manufacture of illusion, and ultimately, loss. Her works hope to generate the potential for an incursion of unreality into a real world, alongside a sense of distance and disappointment in the nature of the image as chimera.",
