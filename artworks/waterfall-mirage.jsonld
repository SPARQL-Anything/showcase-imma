    "description" : "Pat Steir’s works are meditations on nature, time and the nature of art. Adopting the technique of earlier Chinese landscape painting, Steir flings pots of paint at the canvas so that the paint pours down in the same manner as water. This gestural technique is also seen by the artist as a kind of “dialogue” with the New York Abstract Expressionists such as Jackson Pollock.",
