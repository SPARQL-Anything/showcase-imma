    "description" : "Claire Halpinâ€™s practice explores themes and concepts around contested territories and histories through painting, video and installation. Yeoman Yemen is part of a body of work called Jigmap Series, which attempts to navigate the complexity of the contemporary theatre of war, as battlefield expands to battlespace in the information age.
