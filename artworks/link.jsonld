    "description" : "Cecil King’s work ‘Link’ makes economical use of simple elements on meticulously executed canvasses with a narrow peripheral band creating tension between figure and ground. The play between the flat surface and the illusionist third dimension was a continuing preoccupation in his work. Departing from his early semi-realist style, King’s later works have a distinctive minimalist formality, often involving clean blocks of colour cleaved at acute angles.",
