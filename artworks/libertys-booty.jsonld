    "description" : "Liberty’s Booty (1980) uses a matter-of-fact view of middle-class, white prostitution as both a work of sexual demystification and an ironic exposition of American ‘permissiveness’. Old rock anthems and memorabilia keep surfacing like reproachful shards of the sixties. Dick’s last film from her time in New York, Liberty’s Booty  explores ideas of power, womanhood, sexuality and identity. In the film, Dick draws a parallel between prostitution and the desire for success so prevalent in American culture. Candid shots in a brothel in NY are interspersed with imagery of the pope’s visit to Ireland and footage of the characters in NY roaming in the Irish landscape.  ",
