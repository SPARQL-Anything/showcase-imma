    "description" : "Australia’s most famous twentieth century painter, Sidney Nolan is most frequently remembered for his paintings of the bush outlaw Ned Kelly and his gang. Kelly, like Nolan, was Irish-Australian and it was Nolan’s strong Irish connections that led him to visit this country several times and to paint the ‘Wild Geese’ series of paintings. ",
