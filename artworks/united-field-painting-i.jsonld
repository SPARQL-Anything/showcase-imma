    "description" : "‘Untitled Field Painting 1’, like many of John Noel Smith’s paintings, is a diptych. Central to the three horizontal sections is the concept of geometric possibilities. The organic flow of the knot motifs in the middle panel is balanced by the controlled geometric forms of the apparently folded paint in the top panel. The dark tones of the lower section conjure ideas of the earth, the section that holds the ‘field’ together.",
