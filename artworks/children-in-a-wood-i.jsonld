    "description" : "One of Ireland’s best known artists, Louis le Brocquy was born in Dublin in 1916. A self-taught painter, Le Brocquy has always been preoccupied with capturing an aspect of the body as an image of the human being. He was a founding member of the Irish Exhibition of Living Art in 1943 and was awarded La Praelpina at the Venice Biennale in 1956 for his painting ‘A Family’.",
