    "description" : "Painstakingly pressing, burnishing and forming foil Chinese takeaway cartons around the kitchen he used during a residency at IMMA, British-Chinese artist Anthony Key playfully challenges and engages with stereotypes and intricacies of cultural identity. He poignantly conjures a nostalgic memory often associated with the kitchen, invoking a sense of familiarity during a time of discord or change. ‘I believe we carry a metaphorical and invisible kitchen around with us, so this is what I have built.’ Anthony Key, October 2005.",
